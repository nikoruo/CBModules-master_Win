This is brief documentation how to write PBM files using
the PGM module.

--------------------------------------------------------------
#include "pgm.h"

  <open file>
  WritePbmHeader(f, ImageWidth);
  for(y=1; y<=ImageSizeY; y++)
     {
	 for(x=1; x<=ImageSizeX; x++)
	   {
	   OutputPBMBit(f, Pixel[y][x]);
	   }
	 FlushOutputBitBuffer(f);
     }
  <close file>
--------------------------------------------------------------
f is file pointer, and the rest of the variables are integers.

Note that the OutputPBMBit uses static variables to buffer the
output bits into byte. When the buffer byte is filled by 8 bits,
then the routine outpus one byte.

The FlushOutputBitBuffer takes care that incomplete bytes will
also be output at the end of every line. This has no affect on
the image width, but it is merely to prevent pixels from different
lines to be joint into same byte. The side-effect is that few bits
in the last byte of every line are unused if the image wirdth is
not divisible by 8.
